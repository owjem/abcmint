The sources in this directory are unit test cases.  we use google C++ 
testing framework, developers can compile the test case as below:

make -f makefile.unix test

The test file are named as source file name + "Test.cpp", or the main
logic for this test file:

scriptTest.cpp         // test for script.cpp
publicKeyPosTest.cpp   // test case for public key position logic
